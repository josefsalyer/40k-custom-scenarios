# We’re Going on a Snipe Hunt

The mysterious and coy snipe is spoke about as if a myth amongst scholars of the all the races of the galaxy. On one planet - Improbulus IV - they appear when called and Snipe only get stronger the more that are called!

## Setup

This scenario uses a battle royale style of play.
- Set up any length of table with at least  44" width for 2 or more players.
- Players pick a table edge to set up their troops.  The deployment zone is up to 12" in from the table edge and 8" from other players' deployment zones.  Multiple players on one table edge represent a "side"
- Each side alternates taking turns, then all Snipe units take their turn.  Each side alternates controlling Snipe units.


## Actions

### Snipe Hunt

Every turn any unit that ends its movement outside the deployment zone it can perform an action to look for Snipe. A player who has units outside of their deployment zone _must_ perform this action once.  A player can perform this action more than once per turn. A single unit can only summon a single unit of snipe on a turn.

For each model in the unit, roll 1d6. On a 6+ a unit of 1d3 + the turn number of Snipe are created.  For example, on turn one you can summon 1d3+1 models, turn two you can summon 1d3+2, etc.  

Set the Snipe unit up within 9” of any unit - friend or foe. 

The action completes immediately.
