# We’re Going on a Snipe Hunt

The mysterious and coy snipe is spoke about as if a myth amongst scholars of the all the races of the galaxy. On one planet - Improbulus IV - they appear when called and Snipe only get stronger the more that are called!

## Setup

This scenario uses a battle royale style of play.
- Set up any length of table with at least  44" width for 2 or more players.
- Players pick a table edge to set up their troops.  The deployment zone is up to 12" in from the table edge and 8" from other players' deployment zones.


## Actions

### Snipe Hunt

Every turn any unit that ends its movement outside the deployment zone it can perform an action to look for Snipe. A player who has units outside of their deployment zone _must_ perform this action at least once.  Each player _may_ perform the action more than once per turn for each unit outside of their deployment zone.

For each model in the unit, roll 1d6. Consult the following table to determine if a snipe unit appears and how many models are in that unit plus the number of threshold results.

If the unit is a Troops unit for the player, then Snipe add +1 to the roll. 

| Turn | Threshold | Base # of Snipe + positives |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | 6+        | 1d3+1                       |
| 2    | 5+        | 1d3+2                       |
| 3    | 4+        | 1d3+3                       |
| 4    | 3+        | 1d3+4                       |
| 5    | 2+        | 1d3+5                       |


Set the Snipe unit up within 9” of any unit - friend or foe. 

The action completes immediately. 

#### Example

An Ork player has a unit of 10 boys that perform the action on turn 1.  The player rolls 10d6 and gets [ 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6 ].  The player can then set up a Snipe unit that is 1d3+5 in size. 1d3+1 for the turn 1 threshold and 4 more for the number of 5's and 6's they rolled.

## Snipe

Snipe are on a 25mm base.

| 1    | 6"  | 5+  | -   | 4   | 4   | 2   | 2   | 11  | 6+  |
| 2    | 9"  | 4+  | -   | 5   | 5   | 2   | 3   | 11  | 5+  |
| 3    | 12" | 3+  | -   | 6   | 6   | 2   | 4   | 11  | 4+  |
