# Santa Claws

Santa’s Sleigh was hit by an ancient weapon that scattered presents all over the battlefield! These presents contain ancient technology that Santa intended to give to all the good little Magi.

## Scoring

Units may perform an action at the end of their movement phase to pick up a present within 3” of itself. The present then must move with the unit staying within unit coherency. Points are scored by moving a captured present to within 6” of any table edge, or by moving it within 6” of Santa to be returned, or by destroying a present.  A unit can pick up more than one present at a time.

| Action                         | Points |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Pick up a present              | 1      |
| Move a present to a table edge | 3      |
| Destroy a present              | 3      |
| Return a present to Santa      | 5      |
